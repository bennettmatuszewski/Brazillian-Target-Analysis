# Brazillian-Target-Analysis
An analysis of over 100,000 Target orders placed between 2016 and 2018 in Brazil. In this project my goal was to take real world public data and transform it into actionable insights. I started by extracting and cleaning the data from Kaggle and loading it into a supabase database with SQL. I then created an entity relationship diagram to understand the relation between tables. Next, I practiced SQL by creating many tables for testing to understand select statements and how the language works. I then took these tables and popualted them into Power BI, and used the data inside to create an interactive dashboard. 

Tools used: Supabase, SQL, Power BI, Excel
